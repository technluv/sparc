# FaithConnect Specification

## Objective
Develop a real-time audio transcription and AI processing system for faith-based content using OpenAI's APIs.

## Research and Analysis
- Evaluated audio formats and transcription APIs
- Researched caching mechanisms for API optimization
- Analyzed security requirements for API key management
- Investigated microphone integration options

## Project Overview

### Context
FaithConnect is a system designed to capture, transcribe, and process audio content in real-time, utilizing OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription and GPT-4o-mini for content processing.

### Target Audience

- Integration with built-in laptop microphone
- Real-time audio recording capabilities
- Audio quality validation

### Transcription Service
- Integration with OpenAI Whisper API
- Support for multiple accents and languages
- Cost-effective processing ($0.006 per minute)
- Error handling and retry logic

### AI Processing
- Integration with GPT-4o-mini
- Caching mechanism using functools.lru_cache
- Content summarization and insight extraction
- Contextual response generation

### Security
- Secure API key management
- Environment variable configuration
- Secrets Manager integration
- Access control implementation
